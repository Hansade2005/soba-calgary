# Authentication System Setup - SOBA Calgary

This document outlines the complete authentication system implementation for the SOBA Calgary website, including member registration, login, admin dashboard, and role-based access control.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Member Authentication
- **Registration** through membership payment flow
- **Login/Logout** with email and password
- **Password hashing** using bcrypt
- **Session management** with NextAuth.js
- **Profile management** for logged-in members

### 2. Role-Based Access Control
- **Member role** - access to profile and member features
- **Admin role** - access to admin dashboard and management features
- **Super Admin role** - full system access

### 3. Hardcoded Admin Access
- **Email**: `admin@sobaontario.org`
- **Password**: `Mnbvcxzl@5`
- **Role**: `super_admin`

### 4. Admin Dashboard
- **Admin layout** with sidebar navigation
- **Dashboard overview** with statistics and quick actions
- **Members management** - view, edit, activate/deactivate members
- **Role-based access** - only admins can access admin routes

## Environment Variables Required

3. You should be redirected to `/admin` dashboard

### Create Test Member:
1. Register a new member through `/membership`
2. Complete the payment process
3. Login with the member credentials
4. Access `/profile` to test member features

### Test Member Features:
1. Register as a regular member
2. Login and access `/profile`
3. Update profile information
4. Test authentication flows

## Troubleshooting

### Database Connection Issues:
- Ensure `DATABASE_URL` is correctly set
- Check Neon database is accessible
- Verify schema is up to date

### Authentication Issues:
- Check `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` is set
- Verify `NEXTAUTH_URL` matches your domain
- Clear browser cookies if needed

### Permission Issues:
- Verify user roles in database
- Check session data in browser dev tools
- Ensure proper role checks in API routes
