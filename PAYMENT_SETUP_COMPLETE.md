### Benefits for SOBA Calgary:
- **Lower Transaction Fees**: Significantly cheaper than credit card processing
- **Faster Settlement**: Real-time transfers with immediate confirmation
- **Higher Limits**: Support for larger donations and payments

### Supported Features:

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Set Up Environment Variables
Create or update your `.env.local` file:

```env
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="sk_test_your_stripe_secret_key_here"
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="pk_test_your_stripe_publishable_key_here"
```

**Note**: Your existing Stripe account already supports Interac if you're in Canada. No additional setup required!

### 2. Test Your Stripe Configuration

npm run test:stripe
```

### 3. Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 4. Test All Payment Flows
- **Donations**: Visit `http://localhost:3000/donations`

## 💳 Payment Method Selection

Users can now choose between two payment methods:

### Credit/Debit Card

### Interac e-Transfer

- Preferred by Canadian users
- Requires Canadian bank account

## 🔄 How It Works

### Old Flow (Card Only):
```
Payment → Stripe Card Processing → Success Page → Verify API → Database
```

### New Flow (Card + Interac):
```
User Selects Payment Method → 
  ├── Card: Stripe Card Processing → Success Page → Verify API → Database
  └── Interac: Stripe Interac Processing → Success Page → Verify API → Database
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ No webhook configuration needed
- ✅ Real-time payment verification for both methods
- ✅ Better error handling
- ✅ Works with standard Stripe account
- ✅ More secure (immediate verification)
- ✅ **NEW**: Lower fees with Interac option

## 🎯 User Experience

- **Atomic updates**: Database only updated after successful verification
- **Error recovery**: Failed verifications don't leave orphaned records
- **Bank-level security**: Interac uses established banking security protocols

## 📊 Database Updates

Each payment type updates the appropriate database table:

| Payment Type | Table | Updates |
|-------------|-------|---------|
| Donations | `donations` | `status` → "completed", `stripePaymentIntentId` |
| Memberships | `members` | `isPaid` → true, `stripeCustomerId`, `updatedAt` |
| Store Orders | `storeOrders` | `status` → "completed", `stripePaymentIntentId` |

## 🚀 Production Deployment

1. **Replace test keys** with live Stripe keys in production environment
2. **Update environment variables** on your hosting platform
3. **Test all payment flows** in production with both payment methods
4. **Monitor verification endpoints** for any errors
5. **Verify Interac is enabled** in your Stripe dashboard for Canadian accounts

## 💰 Cost Savings with Interac

### Estimated Savings for SOBA Calgary:

**Typical Credit Card Processing:**
- Rate: 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction
- $100 donation = $3.20 in fees

**Interac e-Transfer Processing:**
- Rate: Significantly lower (varies by processor)
- $100 donation = Typically $0.50-$1.00 in fees
- **Potential savings: 60-85% on transaction fees**

### When to Recommend Each Method:

**Recommend Card Payment:**
- International donors
- Users without Canadian bank accounts
- Small transactions under $20
- Users preferring credit card rewards

**Recommend Interac Payment:**
- Canadian donors
- Larger donations/payments
- Cost-conscious users
- Regular/recurring supporters

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### If payments aren't working:
1. Run `npm run test:stripe` to verify configuration
2. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
3. Check server logs for API errors
4. Verify environment variables are set correctly
5. Ensure Canadian location for Interac testing

### If Interac verification fails:
- Ensure user has Canadian bank account
- Check that Interac is enabled in Stripe dashboard
- Verify IP location is Canadian for testing
- Users will see clear error messages with retry options

### Common Issues:
- **Interac not available**: User may not be in Canada or using non-Canadian bank
- **Payment timeout**: Users need to complete Interac flow within time limit
- **Bank authentication failed**: User should retry with correct banking credentials

## 📞 Support

Your payment system now supports both traditional card payments and Interac e-Transfer, providing Canadian users with their preferred payment method while potentially reducing transaction costs for SOBA Calgary.

**Payment Methods Supported:**
- ✅ Credit/Debit Cards (Visa, Mastercard, American Express)
- ✅ Interac e-Transfer (Canadian bank transfers)

**Happy payments! 🎉** 

## 🔧 Developer Notes

### Frontend Integration
To add payment method selection to any form, import and use the PaymentMethodSelector component:

```tsx
import PaymentMethodSelector from "@/components/Common/PaymentMethodSelector";

// In your form component
const [paymentMethod, setPaymentMethod] = useState<"card" | "interac">("card");

<PaymentMethodSelector 
  onPaymentMethodChange={setPaymentMethod}
  selectedMethod={paymentMethod}
/>
```

### Backend API Updates
All checkout APIs now accept a `paymentMethod` parameter:

```json
{
  "amount": 100,
  "category": "General Fund",
  "paymentMethod": "interac"  // or "card"
}
```

The API automatically configures Stripe checkout with the appropriate payment method type.
