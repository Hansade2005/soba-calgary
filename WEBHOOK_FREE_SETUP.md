# Stripe Payment Setup Without Webhooks

This guide explains how to set up Stripe payments using only your secret and publishable keys, without requiring webhook configuration.

## Overview

The modified implementation replaces webhook-based payment verification with direct session status checking. This approach is perfect when you have limited access to your Stripe account but still have your API keys.

## Required Environment Variables

You only need these two Stripe environment variables in your `.env.local` file:

```env
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="sk_test_your_stripe_secret_key_here"
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="pk_test_your_stripe_publishable_key_here"
```

**Note:** You do NOT need `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` for this implementation.

## How It Works

### Previous Flow (with webhooks):
1. User completes payment on Stripe
2. Stripe sends webhook to your server
3. Webhook updates database
4. User sees success page

### New Flow (without webhooks):
1. User completes payment on Stripe
2. User redirected to success page with session ID
3. Success page calls verification API with session ID
4. Verification API checks payment status directly with Stripe
5. Database updated based on payment status
6. User sees appropriate success/error message

## Modified Files

### New API Endpoints Created:
- `app/api/donations/verify-payment/route.ts` - Verifies donation payments
- `app/api/membership/verify-payment/route.ts` - Verifies membership payments
- `app/api/store/verify-payment/route.ts` - Verifies store order payments

### Updated Pages:
- `app/(site)/donations/success/page.tsx` - Now automatically verifies donation payments
- `app/(site)/membership/success/page.tsx` - Now automatically verifies membership payments
- `app/(site)/shop/success/page.tsx` - Now automatically verifies store order payments

### Updated Checkout Endpoints:
- `app/api/store/create-checkout/route.ts` - Now creates database records before payment

## Payment Types Supported

All three payment types in your application now work without webhooks:

1. **Donations** - Community support donations with category selection
2. **Memberships** - SOBA Calgary membership registration with $100 fee
3. **Store Orders** - Merchandise purchases with shipping to Canada

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **No webhook configuration needed** - Works with just API keys
2. **Real-time verification** - Payment status checked immediately when user lands on success page
3. **Error handling** - Shows appropriate messages if payment fails or is incomplete
4. **Secure** - Uses server-side API to verify payments with Stripe
5. **User-friendly** - Loading states and clear error messages
6. **Complete coverage** - All payment flows now work consistently

## Testing

1. Set up your environment variables with your Stripe keys
2. Start your development server: `npm run dev`
3. Test all payment flows:
   - Make a donation at `/donations`
   - Register for membership at `/membership`
   - Purchase items from the store at `/shop`
4. After each payment, you'll be redirected to the respective success page
5. Each page will automatically verify the payment and update your database

## Important Notes

- This approach is more secure than webhook-only verification because it happens in real-time
- Users will see a loading state while payment is being verified
- If verification fails, users get clear error messages and can retry
- The database is only updated after successful payment verification
- All payment types (donations, memberships, store orders) follow the same verification pattern

## Fallback for Failed Verifications

If a user somehow reaches a success page without a valid session ID or if verification fails:
- They'll see an error message
- They can click "Try Again" to return to the respective payment form
- No incomplete records are left in the database

## Database Updates

The verification endpoints update the following tables:
- **Donations**: Updates `status` to "completed" and stores `stripePaymentIntentId`
- **Memberships**: Sets `isPaid` to true, stores `stripeCustomerId`, and updates `updatedAt`
- **Store Orders**: Updates `status` to "completed" and stores `stripePaymentIntentId`

## Production Considerations

When deploying to production:
1. Replace test keys with live Stripe keys
2. Ensure your success URLs are correctly configured in your Stripe checkout sessions
3. Monitor the verification API endpoints for any errors
4. Consider adding additional logging for payment verification attempts
5. Test all three payment flows thoroughly

This implementation provides a robust payment system without requiring webhook access to your Stripe account.
